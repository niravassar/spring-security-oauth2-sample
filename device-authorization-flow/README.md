## Relevant Information:

Use the Device Flow if your application runs on a device that is input constrained. For example, a command line application that cannot provide a web browser to users. Unlike most OAuth2 flows, Device Flow does not require using redirect URLs, callbacks, or the client secret. Instead, it requires getting a `device_code`, and then the applicationâ€™s `client_id` and the `device_code` are used to get an access token.

When we test access [http://localhost:8070/](http://localhost:8070/) in the browser.
